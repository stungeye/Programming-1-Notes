# Arrays
{: .no_toc }

Arrays are the simplest C++ container for storing ordered data of a uniform type. 

Two types of array are available:

* Basic arrays as defined in the C programming language. 
* The enhanced `std::array` from the C++ Standard Library.

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Unless your collection size is fixed, [`std::vector`](/Programming-1-Notes/docs/06-container-structures/03-vectors.html) should be preferred over arrays.
{: .d-inline-block }

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

With Unreal Engine use the [`TArray` container class](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/UnrealArchitecture/TArrays/index.html) in place of arrays *and* vectors.

## C-Style Arrays

As the name implies, _C-Style Arrays_ are arrays as defined in the C programming language.

They are only presented here because you may run into them in legacy C++ code.

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Avoid using C-Style Arrays in C++.
{: .d-inline-block}

## C-Style Arrays Definition

C-Style Arrays are defined with a type and a length.

```cpp
int primes[4]{}; // An array of four ints.
```

Arrays can be initialized when declared:

```cpp
int primes[4]{2, 3, 5, 7};
```

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

Array length cannot be changed once defined.
{: .d-inline-block}

## C-Style Array Set and Get

We can store and retrieve data into the array positions using zero-base indexes and square braces:

```cpp
int primes[4]{}; // An array of four ints.

primes[0] = 2; // First element has index 0
primes[1] = 3;
primes[2] = 5;
primes[3] = 7; // Last element has index 3 (length-1)

// Retrieve array elements by position:
int sum = primes[0] + primes[1] + primes[2] + primes[3]
```

## C-Style Array Length

The length of an array can be retrieve using `std::size()` from the `<iterator>` header:

```cpp
#include <iterator>

int main() {
  int fibonacci[7]{1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13};
  int length = std::size(fibonacci);
}
```

âš¡ Warning:
{: .label .label-red}

The `std::size()` function won't work on arrays passed as arguments to functions.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Copying C-Style Arrays

C-Style arrays are not copied by using the assignment operator:

```cpp
double copy[4]{1,2,3,4};
double pasta[4];

// This will not make a copy:
pasta = copy; // Compiler Error: Array type is not assignable.
```

Instead we need to use `std::copy` from the `<algorithm>` header:

```cpp
std::copy(std::begin(copy), std::end(copy), std::begin(pasta));
```

## The C++ Standard Array

`std::array` was designed as a zero-overhead wrapper for C-Style Arrays.

Standard Array includes the following enhancements over C-Style Arrays:

- Easily assigned and copied.
- Length can be determined when passed into a function.
- The length and type can be inferred when initialized during declaration.

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green}

Always prefer `std::array` over C-Style arrays. Lots to gain, little to lose.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Defining Standard Arrays

To use a standard array we must first include the correct header:

```cpp
#include <array>
```

Standard arrays are defined with a type and a size:

```cpp
// Array of five integers
std::array<int, 5> evenNumbers;
```

The type and size can be inferred if an initializer list is provided:

```cpp
std::array evenNumbers{2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
```

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

Uninitialized array positions default to a value of zero.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Standard Array Length

A standard array can be queried for its own length using the `size()` method.

```cpp
std::array evenNumbers{2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
int length = evenNumbers.size();
```

## C-Style vs Standard Array

Here's a program that demonstrates some of the differences between `std::array` and C-Style Arrays.

## Out-of-Bounds Behaviour

Both C-Style and Standard Arrays are missing array boundary checking. Historically this has been (and continues to be) a major source of bugs and security exploits.

<iframe height="600px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@stungeye/Array-Out-of-Bounds?embed=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Manually include guards in your code to prevent out-of-bounds reads or writes.
{: .d-inline-block }

## Looping Over Standard Arrays

The two simplest ways to loop over standard arrays:

<iframe height="715px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@stungeye/Standard-Array-Loops?embed=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

The loop variable `i` will be of type `std::size_t`. [More on this type](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/size_t).
{: .d-inline-block}

## Copying Arrays

An easier way to copy arrays is to use the array _copy constructor_:

```cpp
  std::array arrayOne{ 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
  std::array arrayTwo{ arrayOne }; // Copy arrayOne into arrayTwo.
```

## Standard Arrays as Function Arguments

Standard Arrays can be received by function parameters.

Unlike C-Style Arrays, Standard Arrays don't lose their length information once inside the function.

```cpp
double calculateAverage(std::array<double, 5> data) {
  double sum{0.0};
  for (auto number : data) {
    sum += data;
  }
  return sum / data.size();
}
```

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

When passing a Standard Array to a function, a copy of the array will be made.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Passing Arrays by Reference

C++ functions are _pass-by-value_ by default, meaning copies are made of the arguments passed to a function.

We can switch to _pass-by-reference_ with the `&` operator. Passing a reference to an argument avoids the performance hit of the copy.

```cpp
// Array passed as a reference for performance and as a const for safety:
double calculateAverage(const std::array<double, 5>& data) {
  // Identical function body as above.
}
```

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

For safety, we mark reference arguments as immutable using `const`.
{: .d-inline-block }

Without the `const` we might accidentally change the array while in the function, affecting the referenced array outside of the function.

## Vector > Standard Array > C-Style Arrays

Above we stated that you should prefer Standard Arrays over C-Style Arrays.

C++ also has a collection type called a Standard Vector, which is similar to a `std::array`, but without a fixed length. We'll cover vectors in [the next section](/Programming-1-Notes/docs/06-container-structures/03-vectors.html).

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Unless your collection length is fixed, prefer `std::vector` over `std::array`.
