# Pointers

It can sometimes be handy to access the data stored at a specific address within our computer's memory. In C++ this is accomplished using a special kind of variable called a _pointer_.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Retrieve the memory address of a variable using the address-of operator.
- Read the data stored at a specific memory address using the indirection operator.
- Store memory addresses to pointers.
- Guard against undefined behaviour by using and testing for null pointers.
- Explain the difference between pointers and references.
- Pass functions as arguments to other functions using `std::function` or function pointers.
- Describe how stack and heap allocation are used to store variable data.
-
