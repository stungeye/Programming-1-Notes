## The Address-Of Operator

When we store data in a variable, that data gets stored in our computer's Random Access Memory (RAM).

We can access the memory address of any variable using the address-of operator `&`:

## The Indirection Operator

What can we do with the memory address of a variable? Not much without the indirection operator `*`.

Using this operator, we can access the data stored at a particular memory address. This is sometimes called _dereferencing_.

## What are Pointers?

The address-of and indirection operators aren't too exciting on their own, but they are crucial for understand the concept of _pointers_.

A pointer is a type of variable used to store the memory address of another variable. In this way, a pointer "_points to_" another variable.

When people talk about C or C++ being confusing this opinion usually has something to do with pointers (and manual memory management).

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

The address-of operator `&` returns a pointer, not a raw number for the memory address.

## Defining and Initializing Pointers

We declare pointers by placing an asterisk after the data type in the declaration.

```cpp
  // Create an integer variable:
  int wholeNumber{ 42 };
  // Create a pointer to the integer variable:
  int* numberPointer{ &wholeNumber };
  // Access the value 42 by way of the variable:
  std::cout << " wholeNumber: " << wholeNumber << "\n";
  // Access the value 42 by dereferencing the pointer:
  std::cout << " *numberPointer: " << *numberPointer << "\n";
  // Change the value of wholeNumber using the pointer:
  (*numberPointer)++; // wholeNumber is now 43
```

âš¡ Warning:
{: .label .label-red}

The pointer definition use of an asterisk is different from the indirection operator.

## Redefining a Pointer

After a pointer has been defined and initialized we can also change what it points to.

## Pointers and Arrays

Many collections in C++ are implemented using pointers. Look back over [our module on iterators](/Programming-1-Notes/docs/06-collections/05-iterators.html) and you'll see how similar pointers are to iterators.

C-style arrays are also implemented using pointers, and we can use what is call _pointer arithmetic_ to access elements within an array:

âš¡ Warning:
{: .label .label-red}

Pointer arithmetic can be dangerous if you point beyond array boundaries.
