# Pointer Basics 
{: .no_toc }

Program variables are each stored at a different address within our computer's memory. *Pointers* can be used to access the contents of variables stored at specific memory addresses.

## The Address-Of Operator

When we store data in a variable, that data gets stored in our computer's Random Access Memory (RAM).

We can access the memory address of any variable using the address-of operator `&`:

```cpp
#include <iostream> // std::cout
#include <string>   // std::string

int main() {
  int wholeNumber{ 42 };
  float decimalNumber{ 3.14159 };
  std::string name{ "Wally Glutton" };

  std::cout << "The number " << wholeNumber 
            << " is stored at memory address " 
            << &wholeNumber << ".\n";

  std::cout << "The number " << decimalNumber 
            << " is stored at memory address " 
            << &decimalNumber << ".\n";

  std::cout << "The string " << name 
            << " is stored at memory address " 
            << &name << ".\n";
}
```
## The Indirection Operator

What can we do with the memory address of a variable? Not much without the indirection operator `*`.

Using this operator, we can access the data stored at a particular memory address. This is sometimes called _dereferencing_.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int wholeNumber{ 42 };

  std::cout << "wholeNumber: " << wholeNumber << "\n";
  std::cout << "&wholeNumber: " << &wholeNumber << "\n";
  std::cout << "*(&wholeNumber): " << *(&wholeNumber) << "\n";
}
```

## What are Pointers?

The address-of and indirection operators aren't too exciting on their own, but they are crucial for understanding the concept of _pointers_.

A pointer is a type of variable used to store the memory address of another variable. In this way, a pointer "_points to_" another variable.

When people talk about C or C++ being confusing this opinion usually has something to do with pointers (and manual memory management).

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

The address-of operator `&` returns a pointer, not a raw number for the memory address.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Defining and Initializing Pointers

We declare pointers by placing an asterisk after the data type in the declaration.

```cpp
// Create an integer variable:
int wholeNumber{ 42 };

// Create a pointer to the integer variable:
int* numberPointer{ &wholeNumber };

// Access the value 42 by way of the variable:
std::cout << " wholeNumber: " << wholeNumber << "\n";

// Access the value 42 by dereferencing the pointer:
std::cout << " *numberPointer: " << *numberPointer << "\n";

// Change the value of wholeNumber using the pointer:
(*numberPointer)++; // wholeNumber is now 43

// Careful!
*numberPointer++ // This will increment the pointer, not the deferenced variable!
```

âš¡ Warning:
{: .label .label-red}

The pointer-definition use of an asterisk is different from the indirection operator.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Reassigning a Pointer

After a pointer has been defined and initialized, we can reassign it to point to a different variable.

This is called pointer reassignment, also known as *reseating* the pointer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
  std::string sillyString{ "The rain in Spain falls mainly due to pain." };
  std::string* stringPointer{ &sillyString }; // Pointer to sillyString

  std::cout << " stringPointer: " << stringPointer << "\n";
  std::cout << "*stringPointer: " << *stringPointer << "\n\n";

  // Change what stringPointer points to:
  std::string secondString{ "WOWZA COWZA!" };
  stringPointer = &secondString;
  std::cout << "After changing what stringPointer points to:\n";
  std::cout << " stringPointer: " << stringPointer << "\n";
  std::cout << "*stringPointer: " << *stringPointer << "\n";
}
```

## Example: C-Array Pointer Navigation

Many collections in C++ are implemented using pointers. Look back over [our module on iterators](/Programming-1-Notes/docs/06-collections/05-iterators.html) and you'll see how similar pointers are to iterators.

C-style arrays are contiguous blocks of elements; pointers can be used to traverse them because array expressions "decay" to pointers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator> // std::size()

int main() {
  int primes[4]{ 2, 3, 5, 7 };
  size_t arrayLength{ std::size(primes) };

  // Here, primes decays to an int* pointing to the first element of the array:
  std::cout << "First element: " << *primes << "\n";

  // Other pointers can also point to the first element:
  int* arrayPointer{ primes };
  std::cout << "First element: " << *arrayPointer << "\n";

  // We can even use a pointer to traverse the array like an iterator:
  for(int* pointer{ primes }; pointer < (primes + arrayLength); ++pointer) {
    std::cout << *pointer << "\n";
  }
}
```

âš¡ Warning:
{: .label .label-red}

Pointer arithmetic can be dangerous if you point beyond array boundaries.

## Pointers and Const

The concept of `const` can be applied to pointers in a few different ways:

- Regular pointers cannot point to `const` variables:

```cpp
const int answer{ 42 };
int* answerPointer{ &answer }; // COMPILE ERROR: A non-const pointer can't point to const variables.
```

- Pointers can be made to point to `const` variables, but the pointer can be reassigned:

```cpp
const int answer1{ 42 };
const int answer2{ 999 };
const int* answerPointer{ &answer1 }; // Pointer to const int. Note: const comes before type.
answerPointer = &answer2;             // Weird, but also fine!
(*answerPointer) = 12;                // COMPILE ERROR: Cannot change a const value.
```

- Pointers can also be made `const`, meaning they cannot be changed after initialization:

```cpp
int answer1{ 42 };
int answer2{ 999 };
int* const answerPointer{ &answer1 }; // Const pointer. Note: const comes after type.
answerPointer = &answer2;             // COMPILE ERROR: Const pointers cannot be reassigned.
```

- We can even have const pointers to const variables:

```cpp
const int answer1{ 42 };
const int* const answerPointer{ &answer1 }; // Double const!
```

## Uninitialized Pointers

Unitialized pointers, sometimes called _wild pointers_ contain what is known as a _garbage address_.

```cpp
double e{ 2.71828 };
double* validPointer{ &e }; // Points to the memory address of the 'e' variable.
double* garbagePointer; // Uninitialized. Contains a garbage address.
```

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Dereferencing a wild pointer is undefined behaviour and should be avoided.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Null Pointers

There is a special literal value `nullptr` we can assign to pointers to indicate that they don't point to anything.

```cpp
int* nullPointer1{ nullptr }; // Manually made null using the nullptr literal.
int* nullPointer2{};          // An empty initializer will also create null pointers.
```

Previously assigned pointers can also be made null.

```cpp
double e{ 2.71828 };
double* validPointer{ &e }; // Points to the memory address of the 'e' variable.
validPointer = nullptr;     // Previously valid pointers can be made null.
```

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Uninitialized pointers should always be explicitly made into _null pointers_.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Guarding Against Dereferencing a Null Pointer

Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behaviour.

```cpp
int* pointer{}; // Creates a null pointer
std::cout << *pointer; // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR!
```

As such, we should _always_ guard pointer access with a boolean test.

```cpp
// METHOD #1:
if (pointer != nullptr) {
  // pointer isn't null, so we can access it:
  std::cout << *pointer;
}

// METHOD #2:
if (pointer) { // Non-null pointers are "truthy" while nullptr is "falsy".
  // pointer isn't null, so we can access it:
  std::cout << *pointer;
}
```

âš¡ Warning:
{: .label .label-red}

Pointers that evaluate as true aren't guaranteed to point to a valid memory location.
{: .d-inline-block}

## NULL and 0 for Null Pointers

In legacy code you will often see the number `0` or the preprocessor macro `NULL` used in place of `nullptr`. [Subtle bugs](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/pass-by-address-part-2/) can be triggered when using `0` or `NULL`.

ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
{: .label .label-green }

Always use `nullptr` when using C++ 11 or greater, even when updating legacy code.
{: .d-inline-block}

## Pointers vs References

At this point you might be wondering why C++ includes both pointers and references when they appear to offer nearly identical functionality.

The short answer: C++ inherited pointers from C and references were added later.

References should be preferred over pointers because:

- Reference syntax is cleaner than pointer syntax. (No need for the indirection and address-of operators.)
- References are safer than pointers as they must always refer to a valid variable. (Unlike with pointers, there is no such thing as an uninitialized reference or a null reference.)
- That said, we can still get "dangling" references if the reference outlives the reffered object!

ðŸŽµ Note:
{: .label .label-yellow}

In legacy code (or in Unreal Engine C++) pointers are everywhere and cannot be avoided.
