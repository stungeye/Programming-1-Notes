## Pointers and Functions

Pointers can be passed to and returned from functions.

In Unreal Engine C++ code, for example, the following is common:

- Passing around game objects using function parameters that are pointers.
- Built-in functions that return pointers to objects managed by the engine.
- Binding callback functions to events or timers using function pointers.

We'll look at function pointers next.
