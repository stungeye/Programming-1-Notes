# Pointers and Polymorphism
{: .no_toc }

Back when we first learned about inheritance, I promised we'd eventually learn about polymorphism in C++. We had to wait until now because of the need for pointers.

## Polymorphism in C++

Some quick OO terms to remember from [our classes module](/Programming-1-Notes/docs/08-user-defined-types/03-classes.html):

- **Base Class** - A class that other classes inherit from. (Often called a _parent class_ in other languages.)
- **Derived class** - A class that inherits from a base class. (Often called a _child class_ in other languages.)
- Derived classes share an interface inherited from their common base class.
- **Subtype Polymorphism** - The ability to use the shared interface of derived classes by way of references or pointers to the base class.

## An Example Hierarchy

Imagine the following simple class hierarchy:

- An abstract base class `Pawn`:
  - One `health` member of type `double`.
  - Simple constructor.
  - Function `std::string identify()`.
- Derived class `Player`:
  - Simple constructor that makes use of parent constructor.
  - Overrides `std::string identify()`.
- Derived class `Enemy`:
  - Simple constructor that makes use of parent constructor.
  - Overrides `std::string identify()`.

## The Polymorphism We Want

The code below shows what we want to be able to do.

Notice that we trigger the polymorphism by way of two overloaded `printPawnId` functions. There's one version that takes a reference to a `Pawn` and another that takes a pointer to a `Pawn`. 

The overloaded functions aren't both required. We've implemented both to demonstrate polymorphism via references and pointers.

```cpp
// Accepts Player or Enemy References:
void printPawnId(const Pawn& p) {
  std::cout << "REF - " << p.identify() << "\n";
}
// Accepts pointers to Player or Enemy object:
void printPawnId(const Pawn* p) {
  std::cout << "PTR - " << p->identify() << "\n";
}

// Elsewhere in the code:
Player wally{ 90.0 };
Enemy  daisy{ 100.0 };

printPawnId(wally);  // Prints: REF - Player here!
printPawnId(daisy);  // Prints: REF - Enemy here!
printPawnId(&wally); // Prints: PTR - Player here!
printPawnId(&daisy); // Prints: PTR - Enemy here!
```

## Naive Incorrect Implementation of Polymorphism

Here's a naive and broken implementation of polymorphism for the `Pawn`, `Player` and `Enemy` class. Notice that when we try to polymorphically call a `Player`'s or `Enemy`'s `identify()` method, the `Pawn` implementation is used instead.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Pawn {
  double health;
public:
  Pawn(double health) : health{health} {
    std::cout << "Pawn Constructor\n";
  }
  
  std::string identify() const {
      return "Pawn here!";
  }
};

class Player : public Pawn {
public:
  Player(double health) : Pawn(health) {
    std::cout << "Player Constructor\n";
  };

  std::string identify() const {
    return "Player here!";
  }
};

class Enemy : public Pawn {
public:
  Enemy(double health) : Pawn(health) {
    std::cout << "Enemy Constructor\n";
  };

  std::string identify() const {
    return "Enemy here!";
  }
};

// Polymorphically call identify() on references to Pawn
// objects. Can also be passed Player or Enemy objects.
void printPawnId(const Pawn& p) {
  std::cout << p.identify() << "\n";  
}

// Polymorphically call identify() via pointers to Pawn
// objects. Can also be passed Player or Enemy pointers.
void printPawnId(const Pawn* p) {
  std::cout << p->identify() << "\n";  
}


int main() {
  std::cout << "Constructing a Player: \n";
  Player wally{ 90.0 };
  std::cout << "\nConstructing an Enemy: \n";
  Enemy  daisy{ 100.0 };

  std::cout << "\nPrinting Pawn Ids by Reference: \n";
  printPawnId(wally); // Oh No! Prints: Pawn here!
  printPawnId(daisy); // Oh No! Prints: Pawn here!
  
  std::cout << "\nPrinting Pawn Ids by Pointer: \n";
  printPawnId(&wally); // Oh No! Prints: Pawn here!
  printPawnId(&daisy); // Oh No! Prints: Pawn here!
}
```

## Virtual Functions to the Rescue

A virtual function is a special kind of class member function that, when called, executes the _most-derived_ version of that function. For our example code above to work, we will need to make `identify()` a virtual function in the base `Pawn` class. Although not required, we will mark the `identify()` implementations in the derived classes as overrides using the `override` keyword.

If it doesn't make sense to implement a virtual function in the base class, we can mark it as a "pure virtual function" by replacing the implementation block with `= 0`. Classes with one or more pure virtual functions are said to be "abstract" and therefore cannot be constructed.

We'll make the `Pawn` class abstract in this way.

Make base class destructors virtual so that derived destructors can be used.

## Working Implementation of Polymorphism

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Abstract Base Class Pawn
class Pawn {
  double health;
public:
  Pawn(double health) : health{health} {
    std::cout << "Pawn Constructor\n";
  }
  // Virtual destructor in case we ever want derived destructors.
  virtual ~Pawn() = default;

  // Pure virtual identify() with no function body.
  virtual std::string identify() const = 0;
};

// Derived Class Player
class Player : public Pawn {
public:
  Player(double health) : Pawn(health) {
    std::cout << "Player Constructor\n";
  };

  std::string identify() const override {
    return "Player here!";    
  }
};

// Derived Class Pawn
class Enemy : public Pawn {

public:
  Enemy(double health) : Pawn(health) {
    std::cout << "Enemy Constructor\n";
  };

  std::string identify() const override {
    return "Enemy here!";    
  }
};

// Polymorphically call identify() on references to Pawn objects.
void printPawnId(const Pawn& p) {
  std::cout << p.identify() << "\n";  
}

// Polymorphically call identify() via pointers to Pawn objects.
void printPawnId(const Pawn* p) {
  std::cout << p->identify() << "\n";  
}

int main() {
  std::cout << "Constructing a Player: \n";
  Player wally{ 90.0 };
  std::cout << "\nConstructing an Enemy: \n";
  Enemy  daisy{ 100.0 };


  std::cout << "\nPrinting Pawn Ids by Reference: \n";
  printPawnId(wally);
  printPawnId(daisy);
  
  std::cout << "\nPrinting Pawn Ids by Pointer: \n";
  printPawnId(&wally);
  printPawnId(&daisy); 
}
```

## Polymorphism and Containers

Although polymorphism can be implemented using references or pointers, if we also wish to involve containers we need to use pointers. There's no such thing in C++ as a container of references.

Here's an example of polymorphism using a vector along with unique pointers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <memory>
#include <ctime>

// Abstract Base Class Pawn
class Pawn {
  double health;
public:
  Pawn(double health) : health{health} {
  }
  // Virtual destructor in case we ever want derived destructors.
  virtual ~Pawn() = default;

  // Pure virtual identify() with no function body.
  virtual std::string identify() const = 0;

  std::string healthReport() const {
    return "Health: " + std::to_string(health);
  }
};

// Derived Class Player
class Player : public Pawn {
public:
  Player(double health) : Pawn(health) {
  };

  std::string identify() const override {
    return "Player here! " + healthReport();    
  }
};

// Derived Class Pawn
class Enemy : public Pawn {
public:
  Enemy(double health) : Pawn(health) {
  };

  std::string identify() const override {
    return "Enemy here!  " + healthReport();    
  }
};

// Polymorphically call identify() on references to unique Pawn pointers.
// Reference must be used as we can't copy unique pointers.
void printPawnId(const std::unique_ptr<Pawn>& p) {
  std::cout << p->identify() << "\n";  
}

int main() {
  srand(time(nullptr));

  // Vector of unique pointers to the base Pawn class.
  std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Pawn>> pawns;

  // Randomly add pointers to new Player or Enemy objects.
  for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
   if (rand() > (RAND_MAX / 2)) {
     pawns.emplace_back(std::make_unique<Player>(50 + rand() % 50));
   } else {
     pawns.emplace_back(std::make_unique<Enemy>(50 + rand() % 50));
   }
  }

  // Ranged-for must use a reference since we can't copy unique pointers.
  for(const auto& pawn : pawns) {
    printPawnId(pawn);
  }
}
```
